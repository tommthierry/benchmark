Let user
- select their own llm
- Select their own questions
- Enter their own API Key for openRouter
- Share their own "Game"


FEATURE
- We need to be able to control the prompt for all the different state and have acces to variable like llm answers and all useful contextual variable that will help us create better prompt, more grounded in our situation.



Ranking
- Automated ranking (defined by computer themselve)
- All user generated setup ranking
- We have champs by type of question and their the one called to give the "best answer toc ompare to" / Gives current best reference to other but also deemed to challenged if needed.


UX/UI
- See graph stats of current game in /arena


ARENA
- Multiple type
  - Current automate one
  - Create your own


STATS
- We can see on going game stats in arena
- Main stats
  - Global
  - User
  - ALL
  - Filter
    - Weekly / Month / Year
  - We see the number of game per ranking per filter


Idea
- User can generate as much as they want when they use free ones

- LLM Master when its the jusdging phase will call the BEST CURRENT LLM to get its reponse and ranking of the others and then do its own ranking.
  - This ranking will have more impacgt at the end like more % overall depending on how many there is llm
