Here is what I really want you to focus on:

Now that you know what the project is, you will create a complete, base plan to setup "the base" of our project.
Really the base, so that we can load an hello world type of url in the brower with all our main librarie install, setup, ready to grow and be scaled up.

You know the project, now your job is to investigated, browse, search the lastest best library/setup/architecture for our app.

Really go in depth to check what would be the best setup for us to start with that would let us scale to accomplish our need based on our app logic,concept.

We have our ./docs folder that will now host our docs within multiple sub foler all properly segmented annd clean so that it respect the concept and limit of ai coding agent and their context length limitation.

We also should have the CLAUDE.md that would be the base knowledge that is always inject to your prompt, you can browse to search what the best practice are but for my knowledge and experience is mostly behavioir important concept, important knowledge reference to read, concept, like only the most clear and needed concept and overall knowledge of the app.
