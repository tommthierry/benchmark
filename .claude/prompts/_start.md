# Project Implementation - Next Iteration

## Context & Current Situation
You are taking over an ongoing project implementation. Previous agents have completed various parts of the system. Your role is to continue building upon their work and advance the project toward completion.

### Important Files to Read First (in this order):
1. **SESSION_HANDOFF.md** - Contains the complete handoff notes from the previous agent about what was done and current status
2. **MAIN_PLAN.md** - The comprehensive implementation plan showing overall progress and remaining work

## Your Immediate Tasks

### 1. Situation Analysis (CRITICAL - Do This First)
- Read SESSION_HANDOFF.md to understand:
  - What was just completed
  - Current state of the project
  - Any blockers or issues identified
  - Recommended next steps
- Review MAIN_PLAN.md to see:
  - Overall progress
  - Where we are in the implementation
  - What's next in priority

### 2. Create Your Implementation Plan for This Iteration
After understanding the current state:
- Identify the next logical chunk of work from MAIN_PLAN.md
- Consider dependencies on existing code
- Plan a meaningful, achievable iteration for this session
- Your plan should build upon what exists while maintaining code quality
- Focus on completing one cohesive feature or component

### 3. Execute Your Iteration
- Implement your planned features following project standards
- Integrate with existing codebase properly
- Ensure everything runs properly in the Docker environment
- Test both your new code AND its integration with existing features

### 4. Documentation Updates (MANDATORY)
After completing your work:
- **Update MAIN_PLAN.md**: 
  - Mark newly completed items
  - Update the progress indicator
  - Adjust future plans based on your discoveries
  - Add any new tasks identified during implementation
- **Completely rewrite SESSION_HANDOFF.md**:
  - Document what you accomplished in this session
  - Current state of the entire project
  - What's working and fully tested
  - Clear next steps for the following agent
  - Any new warnings, blockers, or important discoveries
- **Update ./docs/howto/**:
  - Add/update instructions for any new features
  - Ensure run instructions are current and complete

## Big Task Alert

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailed plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible.
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated.

Remember, you can browse the web if you need up to date information, documentation or look for specific libraries at any point.
At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and assess if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements.
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want reusability, DRY and simple clean code.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Build on What Exists**: Understand and properly integrate with existing code
2. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow established patterns and conventions in the codebase
3. **Test Everything**: Test new features AND their integration with existing ones
4. **Validate Assumptions**: Use web browsing to verify library versions, best practices, and current standards
5. **Challenge the Plan if Needed**: If you discover issues or better approaches, document them and adjust
6. **Keep It Clean**: Refactor if needed to maintain code quality as the project grows

## Expected Deliverables

By the end of your session, you should have:
1. ✅ A working new iteration integrated and running in Docker
2. ✅ All existing features still working (no regressions)
3. ✅ Updated MAIN_PLAN.md with current progress clearly marked
4. ✅ Completely new SESSION_HANDOFF.md for the next agent
5. ✅ Updated technical documentation if any architecture decisions were made
6. ✅ Updated/new instructions in ./docs/howto/ for running the enhanced system

## Important Reminders

- 🔍 **Research When Needed**: Verify current best practices and library versions for new components
- 🏗️ **Architecture Matters**: Maintain the architectural integrity established in earlier phases
- 📝 **Document Everything**: Future agents depend on your clear documentation
- 🧪 **Test in Docker**: Everything must run in the Docker environment
- 🔄 **Iterate if Needed**: Don't hesitate to revisit and improve the plan based on discoveries
- ⚡ **Don't Break What Works**: Always ensure existing functionality remains intact
- 🔗 **Integration is Key**: Your code should seamlessly work with what's already built
---

**Remember**: You're continuing the journey, not starting fresh. Respect what's been built, enhance it thoughtfully, and leave clear guidance for the next iteration. Each session should move the project meaningfully forward while maintaining quality and clarity.

# Project Implementation - Phase 1 Kickoff

## Context & Current Situation

You are taking over a project that has completed its initial planning and architecture phase. The previous agent has done extensive research, analysis, and planning work. Your role is to begin the actual implementation.

### Important Files to Read First (in this order):
1. **SESSION_HANDOFF.md** - Contains the complete handoff notes from the previous agent about what was done and current status
2. **MAIN_PLAN.md** - The comprehensive implementation plan for the entire project


## Your Immediate Tasks

### Create Your Implementation Plan for Phase 1
After understanding the situation:
- Break down the first logical chunk of work from MAIN_PLAN.md
- This should be a meaningful but achievable first iteration (think of it as your first "sprint" or "ticket")
- Focus on getting a minimal working version of one core component running in Docker
- Your plan should be specific, actionable, and achievable in this session

### 3. Execute Phase 1
- Implement the first iteration following your plan
- Ensure everything runs properly in the Docker environment
- Test your implementation thoroughly

### 4. Documentation Updates (MANDATORY)
After completing your work:
- **Update MAIN_PLAN.md**: 
  - Mark completed items
  - Add a clear status indicator showing where we are in the overall plan
  - Update any parts that need adjustment based on your discoveries
- **Completely rewrite SESSION_HANDOFF.md**:
  - Document what you accomplished
  - Current state of the project
  - What's working and tested
  - Next steps for the following agent
  - Any warnings, blockers, or important discoveries

## Big Task Alert

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailed plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible.

At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and assess if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements.
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want reusability, DRY and simple clean code.

## Implementation Guidelines
1. **Start Small but Complete**: Your first implementation should be a working piece, not the entire application
4. **Validate Assumptions**: Use web browsing to verify library versions, best practices, and current standards
5. **Challenge the Plan if Needed**: If you discover issues or better approaches, document them and adjust

## Expected Deliverables
By the end of your session, you should have:
1. ✅ A working iteration running in Docker
2. ✅ Updated MAIN_PLAN.md with current progress clearly marked
3. ✅ Completely new SESSION_HANDOFF.md for the next agent
4. ✅ Updated technical documentation if any architecture decisions were made
5. ✅ Clear instructions on how to run what you've built (use the folder ./docs/howto/)

## Important Reminders
- 🔍 **Research First**: Don't assume - verify current best practices and library versions
- 🏗️ **Architecture Matters**: This is a POC that will impact the rest of the project
- 📝 **Document Everything**: Future agents depend on your clear documentation
- 🧪 **Test in Docker**: Everything must run in the Docker environment
- 🔄 **Iterate if Needed**: Don't hesitate to revisit and improve the plan based on discoveries

---

**Remember**: You're not completing the entire project - you're taking the first meaningful step from planning to working code. Make it count, make it solid, and make it clear for the next agent to continue.

FOR CLAUDE

----------------

# Context
This is the complete start of our project, nothing has been done yet and everything is to be setup.

This task is really important as it will impact the rest of the project forever so you really need to be ultra focus and ultra careful about what you do so that everything is clean, clear, well architecture and perfectly setup. We need to always follow best practice in term of coding like DRY, reusable component and make everything clean, not too complex and perflecty balanced.

# Project
The project is described in a conversation type file in projectinfos.md You need to understand fully what we are trying to accomplish here as project. This is the POC that will be installed in a windows, in a WSL2 / ubuntu -> docker environment. You are also running in this environment, but not in the docker container, you live outside the docker so to execute command in docker you will be using docker.


## Current State
We ask another LLM to pre-start the project a bit the same, this is its first analysis, verify and keep what you think is a good idea but make it your own when you think you have a better architecture.

- docs/firstRun.md - Result of the llm about CLAUDE.md and MAIN_PLAN.md
- docs/projectinfos.md - Ideas of the llm of the project



# Task
We want to first update our CLAUDE.md with best practice. 

Read / browse documentation for CLAUDE best practices
https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices
https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1k5slll/anthropics_guide_to_claude_code_best_practices/?rdt=57963
https://dev.to/yigit-konur/the-ultimate-guide-to-claudemd-best-practices-to-turn-claude-into-super-powered-ai-teammate-529p

The based on our project update the CLAUDE.md for the next agent (you) to be best most grounded into the project.

# Plan
Update MAIN_PLAN.md, make it your own as you will be the one executing it in the next iteration. Only plan for this one.
Once the project is clear, clean and ready to be setup you will create a comprehensive and ultra detailed plan that will let us go from 0 to our POC. This plan need to be perflectly though and rethough. What I want is at the end of this plan to be able to run my project in docker and execute my POC. The MAIN_PLAN.md will be as we said ultra detailed and we will have a way to follow where we are in it along the way, this is not something that you will execute in one execution so we need to have a way to understand where we are, what is the next step easily. Along the way we will always document with two type of documentation, the first will be the documentation of our project in term of coding/architecture etc and the second will be the how to run the project documentation (single file for this one).

As you can understand this step is ultra important and the main focus here is to do research/analysis/document and most importantly plan. Your output must be a plan that is validated by multiple source, multiple iteration. You need to think about different way we can do it, think about pro/cons about each step and always focus on the best way for our overall objective.

Do not hesitate in the middle of the execution based on your finding to challenge and revisit the inital plan and redo a planning phase, it is important that your plan go along you coding execution and your discovery. We are in 2025, this project need to be up to date with current library. Do not forget that your training dataset is limited and you have a cutting date so make sure to use the browsing tools to double check your assumptions.

# File: projectinfos.md

The goal is to create an app on which, via my computer, via a docker, I launch my app with the docker commands, and it allows me to access my application via my browser on a local URL, and it allows me to access my Photomaton application. In this application, we see something quite simple, so we see the camera, the webcam, the image, what is happening in real time, and there is a button, mainly. With the button, I will be able to click on it, it will take a photo, and then the goal is that this photo will be sent to an image generation LLM service, like Gemini, Banana, Nano, Banana, the LLM, and it will transform this photo into a cartoon, for example, and send it back to the application, and make it like a Photomaton, but instead of being the real photo, it is transformed and displayed on the screen.

“Le but, c'est aussi d'avoir quelque chose qui va être le fun. Je pense avoir plusieurs boutons qui vont être « nice », donc là ça envoie, ça fait l'image, elle va revenir, elle va être « nice ». Il y a un bouton qui va être « vampire », il y a un bouton qui va être « Simpson », il y a un bouton qui va être différents styles et qui vont permettre de transformer la photo dans ces différents styles pour pouvoir avoir différents types d'outputs artistiques.”
“Une fois que les photos sont prises, j'aimerais qu'elles restent dans une sorte de carousel vertical sur l'écran à droite et qu'on puisse les revoir. Quand on clique sur la photo, on voit la photo originale et la photo transformée. J'aimerais que les photos soient sauvegardées localement, à la fois l'originale et la transformée. J'aimerais que ça soit comme une DB, soit un fichier, vu qu'il ne va pas y en avoir trop. JSON qui sauvegarde dans un folder le path vers les images, le choix qui a été choisi comme style, le timestamp, la photo, le photopath, etc. Je veux aussi, sur l'écran principal, que quand je prends une photo, qu'il y ait une animation qui transforme la webcam, l'image live, qu'il la fasse retater et que l'image transformée apparaît à la place pendant 10 secondes, et après ça revient à l'image de la webcam pour recommencer à prendre une photo. Quand ça prend une photo, il faut qu'il y ait un décompte de 10 secondes qui soit affiché à l'écran. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, et là ça prend une photo avec une animation. L'animation freeze l'image de la webcam, ça fait comme si la photo avait été capturée pendant un petit moment, et après ça met le loading state pour que l'on puisse voir que ça travaille et que l'image est en train de se faire transformer.”
