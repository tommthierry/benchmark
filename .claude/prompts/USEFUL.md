## Big Task Alert

It's a big task and I want you to do it step by step with a clear, complete and detailled plan from where we are to where we want to go and what we want to accomplish here.
Your initial planning concept is not directly linked to the execution so the plan need to be as clear as possible.
Really take time to think about the best options available to us to do this, consider our project structure and what's already implemented within codebase and how it's implemented. Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but could be outdated.

Remember, you can browse the web if you need up to date information, documentation or look for specific libraries at any point.
At anytime if you find something like an error or a new concept that is impacting the plan, make sure to revalidate and asses if the plan is still ok or if it needs adjustments based on the specific situation you are in.

Once you know what you need to know to accomplish your task you will create your plan that will be really linked to our project.
Decide in the best way to do this task for our project, specifications and requirements.
It's a big project so in everything we do/create/update, the main focus is that we want resusability, DRY and simple clean code.



------


Update documentation.

We did a lot of changes in our last iteration and now it is time to update our documentation.
Our documentation lives in the /docs folder. List all folder/files in this folder to understand how we previously structured it.
We also have
- README.md - Should indicate how overall project / overview 
- our CLAUDE.md file that is used to give you context of the project.

You job this time will be to go on and revalidate everything in our app to make sure the documentation corespond and is really up to date.
You have to verify everything under ./app

Make sure to double check things, do not make any assumptions, yes the documentation is good but some section will be outdated and it is your task to enhance and make it up to date.

Make sure to indicate also in CLAUDE.md that this documentation exist and can be used to verify things at any time to help with all coding.


-----

Unit testing.

We are building a complex application and to make sure when we enhance it that we do not break anything that already exist I want to now integrate/create unit testing concept in our app.
Your goal here is to analyze the current state of our app, you can look at the docs (it is up to date) and/or code and create a comprehensive plan for the implementation of unit test in our app. We need to cover the key elements in our app and make sure the test validate those.

I see that you create exemple of unit test. I dont want exemple I want real applicable and useful test for important sections/features that needs to be validated. The goal is that after each iteration we do, we run those test to make sure nothing was broken in our app by the new code. I want you to create all the tests we need in our app. Do you think we covered everything with your current unit tests? If no, adjust and create the one missing.
Also make sure to move the documentation in /docs we also have ./docs/howto where we put documentation that explain how to run or execute things.
I also want you to make the unit testing concept know in CLAUDE.md and to be executed when we are doing major changes. Its ok to not run it when minor changes

# Context
This is the complete start of our project, nothing has been done yet and everything is to be setup.

This task is really important as it will impact the rest of the project forever so you really need to be ultra focus and ultra careful about what you do so that everything is clean, clear, well architecture and perfectly setup. We need to always follow best practice in term of coding like DRY, reusable component and make everything clean, not too complex and perflecty balanced.

Project
The project is described in a conversation type file in docs\project.md You need to understand fully what we are trying to accomplish here as project. This is the POC that will be installed in a windows, in a WSL2 / ubuntu -> docker environment. You are also running in this environment, but not in the docker container, you live outside the docker so to execute command in docker you will be using docker.

Task
The first thing you need to do right now is to understand our project goal / focus and objective. Read the project file. Then you will need to setup yourself as the primary developer for this project and update the CLAUDE.md. Read / browse documentation

https://dev.to/yigit-konur/the-ultimate-guide-to-claudemd-best-practices-to-turn-claude-into-super-powered-ai-teammate-529p
Then backup project.md and then update it with the clean version.

Plan
Once the project is clear, clean and ready to be setup you will create a comprehensive and ultra detailed plan that will let us go from 0 to our POC. This plan need to be perflectly though and rethough. You will browse link there is in the backed up project.md as this is a gold mine of information of documentation and and exemple. What I want is at the end of this plan to be able to run my project in docker and execute my POC. The MAIN_PLAN.md will be as we said ultra detailed and we will have a way to follow where we are in it along the way, this is not something that you will execute in one execution so we need to have a way to understand where we are, what is the next step easily. Along the way we will always document with two type of documentation, the first will be the documentation of our project in term of coding/architecture etc and the second will be the how to run the project documentation (single file for this one).

As you can understand this step is ultra important and the main focus here is to do research/analysis/document and most importantly plan. Your output must be a plan that is validated by multiple source, multiple iteration. You need to think about different way we can do it, think about pro/cons about each step and always focus on the best way for our overall objective.

Do not hesitate in the middle of the execution based on your finding to challenge and revisit the inital plan and redo a planning phase, it is important that your plan go along you coding execution and your discovery. We are in 2025, this project need to be up to date with current library. Do not forget that your training dataset is limited and you have a cutting date so make sure to use the browsing tools to double check your assumptions.
